Jasper 2.0 is always listening; just say his name and tell it something. \n\nJapser 2.0 is able to act like a virtual assistant, with the ability to save notes, tell weather / news, check emails, and look up information, but the most compelling feature Jasper 2.0 is endowed with is the ability to distinguish between commands (where it functions as a personal assistant) and natural conversation.\n\nIf no commands are found after parsing the user's speech, Jasper 2.0 will send the message to Cleverbot's API and output that response. Cleverbot crowdsources its responses and brain by talking to users online and measuring the frequency of the responses and similarity of its messages.","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/projects/jasper-photo.png"},"coverImage":"/assets/projects/jasper-photo.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
