It doesn't have to be a long article or a huge full-stack project, but both show a commitment to producing art not solely done for the sake of generating revenue. It's not a bad thing to do that, but it shows a further care for your work to render it with that accessibility of openness.\n\nDevs who build OSS in a way have a brand to maintain. And again.. a commitment.\n\nTo build OSS is to intertwine yourself with a work, because the day you abandon it is generally the day it becomes legacy tech, hence the term `abandonware`.\n\nSo, why not an open-source collective, of like-minded individuals working together solving common goals?\n\n[https://manic.agency/](https://manic.agency/)\n\nAt Manic Agency, we host and operate the self-managable open-source Synthetic Publishing Platform, or, `The Rabbit Hole`, at [https://manic.agency/blog](https://manic.agency/blog).\n\nSee more information about that: [https://manic.agency/blog/tutorials/contribute](https://manic.agency/blog/tutorials/contribute).\n\nFor most of my serious open-source works and published writings, rather than being posted on this personal website, you will see them hosted at Manic and The Looking Glass.","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/blog/manic-agency/manic-agency-rabbit-hole-vortex.png"},"coverImage":"/assets/blog/manic-agency/manic-agency-rabbit-hole-vortex.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
