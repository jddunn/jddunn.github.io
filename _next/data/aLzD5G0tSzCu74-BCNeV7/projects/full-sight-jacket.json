The LED rings light up corresponding to the direction of the motion sensor (in the back of the jacket). If the movement is somewhere in the middle of the two sensors (the motion sensors have 60 degrees of detection), then both LEDs will light up. After briefly glowing, the system resets.\n\n### Video demo\n\n![Video demo of Full Sight Jacket working on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZs2bT8cg00 =100%x315em)","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/projects/Full-Sight-Jacket-info.jpg"},"coverImage":"/assets/projects/Full-Sight-Jacket-info.jpg"}},"__N_SSG":true}
