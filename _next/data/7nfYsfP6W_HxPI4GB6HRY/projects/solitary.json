Intense, abstractified graphics (majority of which were graphics were done by Alex Addington-White) were created to represent the soundscape (rather than creating a CGI room of the solitary cell) to promote the idea of solitary confinement being a mentally deteriorating experience.","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/projects/solitary-demo.png"},"coverImage":"/assets/projects/solitary-demo.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
