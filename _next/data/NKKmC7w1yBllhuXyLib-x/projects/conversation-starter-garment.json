This was created in collaboration with fashion designer Alexandra Mundel at Parsons, who designed and created the dress out of fiber optic material.\n\n### Video demo\n\n![Conversation starter garment on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOk2qcsxcJA =100%x315em)\n\n","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/projects/conversation-starter-garment.png"},"coverImage":"/assets/projects/conversation-starter-garment.png"}},"__N_SSG":true}
