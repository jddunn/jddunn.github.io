Uses a virtual sonar system built with raycasting and spatial sound.\n\n### Video demo of game\n\n![Virtual blindness game demo on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7_16aSXsRM =100%x315em)\n\nThis was coded in C# in Unity3D, with a lot of consideration placed into environment design and atmospheric audio.\n\nThe sonar is simple but effective, with different pitches playing based on distance and object type with a simple AI giving vocal directions to guide navigation by audio alone. The game has no graphics, and was originally designed to be played in VR with stereo headphones (Google Cardboard), with moving directed by head turning / tilting. The prototype controls were designed for and meant to be played on a track-pad, to emulate the mechanic of moving using directional thrusts via some kind of jet-pack.\n","ogImage":{"url":"/assets/blog/dynamic-routing/cover.jpg"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
