The space warps around you and colors swirl, melding and blending like paint on an artist’s canvas. You feel as though you've been pulled through the eye of a needle, and now everything is inside out and upside down. <br> <br> The tiny door behind you now appears colossal, its wooden frame stretching up and beyond your line of sight.

Suddenly, the room shudders. Whispers creep into your ears, a cacophony of voices from the past, present, and perhaps even the future. Among them, you discern one voice, clear and strong, reciting: \"<i>I can't go back to yesterday because I was a different person then.</i>\" <br><br> The sound of soft tapping distracts you.

Ethereal and shimmering, it's a place where reality fractures into countless shards of memories. <br><br> Each fragment, suspended in the air, pulsates with life, replaying moments from your past. Some are crystal clear, filled with joy or sorrow, while others are distorted, their true nature obscured by the mists of time. Around you, the sounds of laughter, cries, and whispered secrets echo, intertwining to form a haunting melody. <br><br> The fragments beckon, inviting you to relive those moments, to dive deep into the emotions they hold. In the distance, past the swirling memories, you can glimpse another mirror. Its surface is calm, offering a stark contrast to the tumultuous world you're currently in. It seems to promise an escape, a way out of this maze of reflections. <br><br> But the allure of the memories is strong, each fragment promising understanding, closure, or perhaps a chance to relive a cherished moment. Amidst this whirlwind of reflections, one fragment stands out, radiant and inviting. <br><br> It's a sun-drenched meadow, with wildflowers swaying gently in the breeze. The laughter of loved ones fills the air, their faces familiar and filled with joy. It's a day from your youth, a picnic with family and friends, a moment of pure, unbridled happiness. Even your dearest friend is here, the one you never thought you'd see again, that you spent everyday regretting you weren't able to help more. <br> <br> The memory you see is so vivid, so real, that you can almost feel the warmth of the sun on your skin and hear the soft hum of bees nearby. It's a memory you'd always cherished, a day where everything felt right in the world, and as usual your friend is so very very glad to see you. The allure of that moment is irresistible.",

I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?\"</i> <br><br> <b> 2. <u>The Enigma of the Ages</u>:</b> From the very fabric of the corridor, a grand tapestry weaves itself into existence.

In me, the past lingers, but the present flows right through. What am I?\"</i> <br><br> Solving either enigma is whispered to grant an audience with the enigmatic Queen of Reflections, a being said to possess dominion over the tides of time.
