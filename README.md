# Portfolio page

Lives at https://jddunn.github.io/

# Description

SEO-ready portfolio and blog page with a Alice in Wonderland-inspired interactive fiction game on the homepage powered by my text-rpg-engine JS library. Uses GraphQL and GitHub API to build open-source page. All the data fetching from the API and from local markdown files (for the blog and project posts) is done at build time with `getStaticProps`, allowing for static exports so the site can live on a static server like GitHub Pages while allowing for SEO. Blog and project posts are written in Markdown and stored in the repository under `/_posts`. Also uses three.js for an interactive sketch.

Google Analytics functionality is included. The site uses the environment variables `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` and `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` for analytics and GitHub API access.
