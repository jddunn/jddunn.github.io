A more functional redesign of the famous wristworn computer your player has in the Fallout games. I wanted to take the conceptual ideas behind the fictional Pip-Boy and create a more advanced and practical version, that was modular too, so the parts could be replaced and upgraded. I was also inspired by the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and how it could became such a useful tool to Arthur Dent because of its knowledge and talking interface.

## Specs

The Pip-Boy has a 5 inch touch screen, a software-defined radio receiver, Wi-fi / Bluetooth, a motion sensor, a video camera, a microphone, speakers, a Raspberry Pi microcomputer, a rugged SSD filled with books and other data, an analog compass / accelerometer, GPS, and an air contaminants sensor.

It is also capable of running Jasper modules, a virtual assistant library with speech synthesis / recognition and the ability to perform commands, like looking up knowledge and speaking answers to questions. Thus, this Pipboy is a new combination of the original Pipboy and the titular item from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
