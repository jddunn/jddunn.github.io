## Intro

Quire.work will be an all-in-one platform serving customizable virtual assistants for academics, professionals, and businesses alike. These assistants are integrable with many different APIs to allow full automation and task running.

Quire currently transforms forms and static questions into dynamic conversational experiences powered by customizable LLMs. Get better feedback from your customers and automate the process of collecting answers and insights based on AI-powered analysis of responses (sentiment detection, answer validation, pattern recognition). Recruitment screenings for jobs can be easily automated while still being a personalized experience for each candidate.

The platform can also turn any website or product into a knowledge base accessible via chatbot automatically.

## User Flow
- Users login to dashboard with free or paid membership plans.
- Dashboard allows them to create Interviews and add questions and requirements.
- Interviews can be shared with a link or embedded via widget anywhere on the web; interviews can be made private (with login or password) or public. 
- Individual interviews can be tracked, recorded, and exported, separated by session or user (can be anonymous), with insights seen in a CRM dashboard.
- Interview questions can be required or optional and asked in a specific order, or only asked if other questions were answered first. API calls can be made and promotion codes, etc. given out after certain questions.
- Staff can create chatbots to act as knowledge bases internally or for public-facing products, which ingest links automatically for data.
