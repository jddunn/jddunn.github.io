An interactive garment that radiantly lights up when sound gets above a certain level, and remains glowing only when sound is not just continuing, but getting louder as well.

After a certain point, the sound tolerance level is too high, and the top turns off, and the sensors and process resets itself, effectively continually promoting conversations around the garment for it to be lit up. This was created in collaboration with fashion designer Alexandra Mundel at Parsons, who designed and created the dress out of fiber optic material.
