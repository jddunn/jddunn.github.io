Sonance is a cross-platform app built in Unity that immerses users in dynamic soundscapes designed to mimic real life environments, such as a serene forest / river, that actually act as a tool for noise isolation, as the type and volume of sounds adjust with the level of volume detected in the user's environment.

These soundscapes are also designed with ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) in mind, meaning that the sounds are meant to relax you and can actually trigger pleasant physical tingling sensations in the head, also greatly promoting relaxtion.
