An audio-visual experience made in Unity about the dark and disorienting experience of solitary confinement (created for a journalism class focusing on Rikers Island in NYC). 

Made in Unity, SOLITARY is meant to be projected in a large, dark room with surround sound speakers, while the participant stays in the room, alone and with no other possessions, for as long as possible until he can stand the frustration, isolation, and hallucinatory nature of the experience no longer, and chooses to leave.

### Video demo

This was coded in C# in Unity3D, with a lot of consideration placed into environment design and atmospheric audio.

At the end, every participant marks his time log in a record inside the room, with his name and duration of stay public for others to see (almost like a leadership board). Intense, abstractified graphics (majority of which were graphics were done by Alex Addington-White) were created to represent the soundscape (rather than creating a CGI room of the solitary cell) to promote the idea of solitary confinement being a mentally deteriorating experience.
