Everybody should contribute to open-source, the same way every writer should publish things *just* for the sake of publishing to be read. It doesn't have to be a long article or a huge full-stack project, but both show a commitment to producing art not solely done for the sake of generating revenue. It's not a bad thing to do that, but it shows a further care for your work to render it with that accessibility of openness.

Devs who build OSS in a way have a brand to maintain. And again.. a commitment.

To build OSS is to intertwine yourself with a work, because the day you abandon it is generally the day it becomes legacy tech, hence the term `abandonware`.

So, why not an open-source collective, of like-minded individuals working together solving common goals?

At Manic Agency, we host and operate the self-managable open-source Synthetic Publishing Platform, or, `The Rabbit Hole`, at [https://manic.agency/blog](https://manic.agency/blog).

See more information about that: [https://manic.agency/blog/tutorials/contribute](https://manic.agency/blog/tutorials/contribute).

For most of my serious open-source works and published writings, rather than being posted on this personal website, you will see them hosted at Manic and The Looking Glass.
